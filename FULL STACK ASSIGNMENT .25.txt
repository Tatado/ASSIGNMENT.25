1.
Square brackets are lists while parentheses are tuples.
2.
Ierators are objects which use the next() method to get the following values of a sequence. 
Generators are functions that produce or yield a sequence of values using the yield keyword
3.
If the body of a def contains yield, the function automatically becomes a generator function.
4.
The yield statement returns a generator object to the one who calls the function which contains yield,
 instead of simply returning a value.
5.
Map function is faster than list comprehension when the formula is already defined as a function earlier.
 So, that map function is used without lambda expression.
